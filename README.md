## Info ℹ️
Cloud surfer is meant to be easy to use and effective, offering a hybrid between trigger-bot and silent aim to remain as undetectable and as close to natural shooting as possible. No quick snaps, or crazy features just fluid shooting that looks nothing like your average aimbot. It includes a simple debloated UI with numerous features for the users convenience.

- ✖️ **Error margin**: `miss randomly` - Specify room of error for even less detectability.
- 🕵️ **Undetectable**: `avoid bans` - Triggerbot/silent aim ensures no obvious snapping, and when paired with an error margin it just seems like you're cracked rather than exploiting.
