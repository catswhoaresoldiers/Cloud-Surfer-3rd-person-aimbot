## Info
Cloud surfer is meant to be easy to use and effective, offering a hybrid between trigger-bot and silent aim to remain as undetectable and as close to natural shooting as possible. No quick snaps, just fluid shooting that looks nothing like your average aimbot. It includes a simple debloated UI with numerous features for the users convenience.

```lua

## Games
Cloud surfer works for nearly any 3rd person shooter game. Some include: Prison life, da hood, the streets, nearly any military rp game, papers please, and many more.

## Updates
All updates are shown in the changelog in the UI, weekly or daily updates will be present, basically whenever I feel like it. There's much to be added and right now it's just an alpha release of the script.
